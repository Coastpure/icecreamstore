make a new folder in views, name it layouts. make footer, header and main files 

main file looks like this 

@include('layouts.header') // here we import the header file

@yield('content')           // this is the main content, it is written in index.blade

@include('layouts.footer')  // here we import the footer file


make index.blade file

we will eextend it's content to main.blade, it should look like this 

@extends('layouts.main')

{{-- section name should match what you want to inject to (the name inside yield), in this case @yield('content') in main.blade --}}
@section('content')

{{-- here is when we write html that will be extended --}}
    
@endsection
